Hie folks,

This repository contains my learning on Golang Programming language. 
I reffered TheGoProgramming language by Alan A.A. Donovan and Brain W. Kernighan and some youtube channels like Anthony GG and Flo Woelki to understand Go concept. The Go language is unique
in itself with some hint of object orientated paradigm , Concurrency and paralalism taken with go routines and channel.
