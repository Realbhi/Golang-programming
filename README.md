Hie folks,

This repository contains my learning on Golang Programming language. 
I reffered TheGoProgrammingLanguage Book by Alan A.A. Donovan and Brain W. Kernighan and some youtube channels like Anthony GG and Flo Woelki to understand Go concept. The Go language is unique in itself with some hint of object orientated paradigm , Concurrency and paralalism taken with go routines and channels followed by concepts like concurrency patterns ,waitgroups and Mutex.
